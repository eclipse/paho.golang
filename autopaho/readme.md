AutoPaho
========

AutoPaho has a number of aims:

* Provide an easy-to-use MQTT v5 client that provides commonly requested functionality (e.g. connection, automatic reconnection, message queueing).
* Demonstrate the use of `paho.golang/paho`.
* Enable us to smoke test `paho.golang/paho` features (ensuring they are they usable in a real world situation)

## Basic Usage

The following code demonstrates basic usage; the full code is available under `examples/basics`:

```go
ctx, stop := signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)
defer stop()

// We will connect to the Eclipse test broker (note that you may see messages that other users publish)
u, err := url.Parse("mqtt://mqtt.eclipseprojects.io:1883")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

cliCfg := autopaho.ClientConfig{
	BrokerUrls: []*url.URL{u},
	KeepAlive:  20, // Keepalive message should be sent every 20 seconds
	// CleanStartOnInitialConnection defaults to false. Setting this to true will clear the session on the first connection.
	CleanStartOnInitialConnection: false,
	// SessionExpiryInterval - Seconds that a session will survive after disconnection.
	// It is important to set this because otherwise, any queued messages will be lost if the connection drops and
	// the broker will not queue messages while it is down. The specific setting will depend upon your needs
	// (60 = 1 minute, 3600 = 1 hour, 86400 = one day, 0xFFFFFFFE = 136 years, 0xFFFFFFFF = don't expire)
	SessionExpiryInterval: 60,
	OnConnectionUp: func(cm *autopaho.ConnectionManager, connAck *paho.Connack) {
		fmt.Println("mqtt connection up")
		// Subscribing in the OnConnectionUp callback is recommended (ensures the subscription is reestablished if
		// the connection drops)
		if _, err := cm.Subscribe(context.Background(), &paho.Subscribe{
			Subscriptions: []paho.SubscribeOptions{
				{Topic: topic, QoS: 1},
			},
		}); err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("failed to subscribe (%s). This is likely to mean no messages will be received.", err)
		}
		fmt.Println("mqtt subscription made")
	},
	OnConnectError: func(err error) { fmt.Printf("error whilst attempting connection: %s\n", err) },
	// eclipse/paho.golang/paho provides base mqtt functionality, the below config will be passed in for each connection
	ClientConfig: paho.ClientConfig{
		// If you are using QOS 1/2, then it's important to specify a client id (which must be unique)
		ClientID: clientID,
		// The Router will receive any inbound messages (the router can map for you or just pass messages to a single handler)
		Router: paho.NewStandardRouterWithDefault(func(m *paho.Publish) {
			fmt.Printf("received message on topic %s; body: %s (retain: %t)\n", m.Topic, m.Payload, m.Retain)
		}),
		OnClientError: func(err error) { fmt.Printf("client error: %s\n", err) },
		OnServerDisconnect: func(d *paho.Disconnect) {
			if d.Properties != nil {
				fmt.Printf("server requested disconnect: %s\n", d.Properties.ReasonString)
			} else {
				fmt.Printf("server requested disconnect; reason code: %d\n", d.ReasonCode)
			}
		},
	},
}

c, err := autopaho.NewConnection(ctx, cliCfg) // starts process; will reconnect until context cancelled
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
// Wait for the connection to come up
if err = c.AwaitConnection(ctx); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Second)
msgCount := 0
defer ticker.Stop()
for {
	select {
	case <-ticker.C:
		msgCount++
		// Publish a test message (use PublishViaQueue if you don't want to wait for a response)
		if _, err = c.Publish(ctx, &paho.Publish{
			QoS:     1,
			Topic:   topic,
			Payload: []byte("TestMessage: " + strconv.Itoa(msgCount)),
		}); err != nil {
			if ctx.Err() != nil {
				panic(err) // Publish will exit when context cancelled or if something went wrong
			}
		}
		continue
	case <-ctx.Done():
	}
	break
}

fmt.Println("signal caught - exiting")
<-c.Done() // Wait for clean shutdown (cancelling the context triggered the shutdown)
```

## QOS 1 & 2

QOS 1 & 2 provide assurances that messages will be delivered. To implement this a [session state](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901230)
is required that holds information on messages that have not been fully acknowledged. By default `autopaho` holds this 
state in memory meaning that messages will not be lost following a reconnection, but may be lost if the program is 
restarted (a file-based store can be used to avoid this).   

A range of settings impact message delivery; if you want guaranteed delivery, then remember to:

* Use a unique, client ID (you need to ensue any subsequent connections use the same ID)
* Configure `CleanStartOnInitialConnection` and `SessionExpiryInterval` appropriately (e.g. `false`, `600`).
* Use file-based persistence if you wish the session to survive an application restart
* Specify QOS 1 or 2 when publishing/subscribing.

When subscribing at QOS1/2:
* Remember that messages will not be queued until after the initial `Subscribe` call.
* If you subscribed previously (and the session is live) then expect to receive messages upon connection (you do not need
to call `Subscribe` when reconnecting; however this is recommended in case the session was lost).

`example/docker` provides a demonstration of how this can work. You can confirm this yourself using two terminal windows:

| Terminal1                 | Terminal2                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `docker compose up -d`    |                                                                                                           |
|                           | `docker compose logs --follow`                                                                            |
|                           | Wait until you see the subscriber receiving messages (e.g. `docker-sub-1  received message: {"Count":1}`) |
| `docker compose stop sub` |                                                                                                           |
| Wait 20 seconds           |                                                                                                           |
| `docker compose up -d`    |                                                                                                           |
|                           | Verify that `sub` received all messages despite the stop/start.                                           |

Note: The logs can be easier fo follow if you comment out the `log_type all` in `mosquitto.conf`.

## Queue

When publishing a message, there are a number of things that can go wrong; for example:
* The connection to the broker may drop (or not have even come up before your initial message is ready)
* The application might be restarted (but you still want messages previously published to be delivered)
* `ConnectionManager.Publish` may timeout because you are attempting to publish a lot of messages in a short space of time.

With MQTT v3.1 this was generally handled by adding messages to the session; meaning they would be retried if the 
connection droped and was reestablished. MQTT v5 introduces a [Receive Maximum](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901083)
which limits the number of messages that can be in flight (and, hence, in the session).

`ConnectionManager.PublishViaQueue` provides a solution; messages passed to this function are added to a queue and 
transmitted when possible. By default, this queue is held in memory but you can use an alternate `ClientConfig.Queue`
(e.g. `queue/disk`) if you wish the queue to survive an application restart.

See `examples/queue`.
